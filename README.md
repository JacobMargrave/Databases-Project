# Databases-Project

### Overview
This program implements a database-driven to-do list manager in Java that uses a command-line application to create, make changes and/or view certain characteristics of a to-do list where information about each created task, including labels, due dates, etc., are stored in a database that the program automatically creates upon the initial running.  

### Compiling and Running

### Program Design
Due to the complex nature of creating a connection to MYSQL as well as creating shell command templates with Java code written from scratch, we decided to take the easy route and use external executable libraries provided to us in the project description. These libraries are:
* cliche-shell-0.9.9-SNAPSHOT.jar - used for implementing the various program commands through an interactive shell.
* jsch-0.1.53.jar - used for 
* mysql-connector-java-5.1.28.jar - used for connecting to the MYSQL database server.
